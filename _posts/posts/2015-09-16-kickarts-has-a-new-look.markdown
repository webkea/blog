WebKea recently finished a re-design for Kickarts, an Auckland based arts radio show. The site hosts a comprehensive archive of the showâ€™s past episodes and implements search and filter functionality for the archive. Another benefit of the re-design is kickarts.org.nz has now jumped to 1st page google results where it was previously 4th.

Be sure to check it out their new site: [kickarts.org.nz](http://www.kickarts.org.nz).
Catch their weekly show Sunday nights at 8.35pm on 104.6 FM for Auckland, or stream it live from [Planet FM](http://www.planetaudio.org.nz/ab/index.php).
