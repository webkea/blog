Recently while giving the Waka Trust a refresh we were presented with the option to design for a Text-only website. Aside from the logo and a few sponsor tags, there would be no images of any kind. We later brought in a few subtle ones in the form of font-icons and unobtrusive hero/header background. But even with that it just felt like a lot of text that wasn't likely to be parsed or even perused.  It's easy enough to throw down the text, make sure it's readable and call it a day, and in fact the client had been happy with this approach in the past as it's mainly an informational site.  

However we decided to take up the challenge of applying design principles to these globs of text and discovered that it was actually pretty fun. It turns out there is a lot you can do with just text. After all, you could reasonable make the case that design is more about typography and layout than otherwise.

###A few quick tips we picked up along the way

####Fonts

Start off with the right fonts. A nice readable font goes a long ways. Avoid overly stylistic fonts or having too many different fonts. Stick to one or two as a base [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) is a really good resource when you're experimenting here and their fonts can easily be swapped in and out in your stylesheets for fast design concepts/iterations.

####Font Styling

There are probably lots of good typography principles and tips out there but there are two that I usually put right at the top:

1) Contrast your text types with font-weight. Here's a thought, the header/title doesn't necessarily need to be the bold one.

2) Use appropriately line-height. This is something very simple that makes a big difference in my opinion. It will make you text more readable and easier to peruse. There's actually a [science](https://drewish.com/tools/vertical-rhythm/) to using appropriate line-height and vertical rhythm but you'll already be doing more than most if you just change it from the default and adjust to your own aesthetics.

####Semantics

Use paragraphs, lists, quotes, etc as appropriate. Take the time to style these so they look good while still indicating what type they are. HTML5 has a lot of elements for specific text types, such as [blockquote](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp).

####Color

Use color Sparingly. Use colors to highlight areas and sections. Try adjusting greyscale tones on less critical text (such as references).

####Layout

Experiment with your layout for clear separation of areas of information. We made use of a stylistic Horizontal rule and a liberal amount of whitespace. You may also notice how we chose to have our title read vertically up, alternating from one side to the other from section to section. Sometimes a bold stylistic choice like this can give a great effect while still maintaining it's function clearly. We also decided on a bold stylistic convention for the history section by implementing a timeline. While these kinds of styles can work nicely, make sure you stay consistent and don't over-use bold, stylistic choices through-out.

Typography can be a whole speciality in and of itself. You can spend hours looking through various typography-design [galleries](http://www.typographyserved.com). There are really awesome, stylistic pieces of art that never fail to amaze. However I think the fault a lot of people might be tempted to make is to try to amaze constantly, which can be distracting from the purpose of actually serving up informational content. Most Typography ,when done well, is almost invisible. It serves principles of design to the purpose of it's function, which is to be read after all.
