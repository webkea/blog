Before it started, my business partner and myself had talked about starting our own business for quite a while. We both worked for the same employer, in the same team, and everyday we'd talk and dream about leaving behind our jobs to start something great. We tried to play it safe and started moonlighting with web design and development. It turns out, the more we ventured into this world, the more we enjoyed it, and the more we craved a change in our lives.

But you can only get so far while playing it safe and besides working two jobs isn't a sustainable lifestyle for the long-term. We kept punching in and out but then one day, an opportunity came along. The Company we worked for was restructuring and we informed we could be laid-off as a result. After enquiring about the redundancy pay-out (severance package), my co-worker and I took a break from work and took a walk.

It's nice to get out of the office and just walk through the city and parks near by. It sort of helps you get out of the mind-frame that the office is your life's reality and you can see that a much bigger reality exists with more possibilities and bigger potentials.

It didn't take us long to decide. The next day we both volunteered for redundancy. It felt good to put our hands up. After all, it meant two other people who probably really needed their jobs would get to keep them and we would essentially be paid to quit, after which, we would move on to exploring bigger realities.

I didn't know how I was going to pay my mortgage or support my family, but I knew I would somehow. We weren't just stepping off a ledge, we were leaping into the abyss with full faith that we would learn to fly before we hit bottom.

So this is where it starts. As of next week, we're doing [WebKea](http://webkea.co.nz) full-time. Here's to believing in yourself and pursuing what you love :)
